 * @brief Handle for controlling LEDs on a specific device

 * This class provides an interface for controlling RGB LEDs on SC-link connected devices.
 * LEDs are identified by their index (0-based), which can be obtained from the device's
 * FeedbackType::rgb_light entries in DeviceInfo.
 *
 * Only one LedControl can be created for each device within Session.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *     // Step 1: Declare which LEDs you want to control
 *     uint32_t indices[] = {0, 1};
 *     led_control.setControlledLeds(indices, 2);
 *
 *     // Step 2: Set colors for the controlled LEDs
 *     RgbColor colors[] = {{255, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 255}};
 *     led_control.setColors(colors, 2);
 * }
